					There are 4 colors that each represent the current status of the tables in the resturaunt. When you want to change the status of a table, simply tap!<br>
					For example: If you want to signal a Buser to let them know that a table needs to be cleaned <span style="color: #9D9C9C">(Current status should be In Use)</span>, simply tap on the table to Red <span style="color: #F16464">(Needs to be cleaned)</span>.<br>
					If the table is <span style="color: #5FAAF0">Blue</span>, this indicates that the table is currently waiting for the next customer to arrive to their table. If they do not arrive within 5 minutes, the status should be changed to <span style="color: #9FE15C">Available</span>, and it cna be switched to <span style="color: #5FAAF0">Blue</span> again when the next customer has been moved up the waiting list.
